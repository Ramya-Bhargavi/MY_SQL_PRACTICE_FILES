 # Columns in the SELECT statement must either have an aggregate function applied over them or be included in the GROUP BY clause..
 # select is the subset and group by is super SET
 
 13.
 # find min, max, avg rating and group by the avg_rating and remove the null parts
   AND ORDER BY RATING ---- error
   
 # NOTES:
 # Order by should contain cols which are in select query which will be present in group by query
 
 
 14. display maxm rating also rating greater than 5 --- where clause --- error
 15. display sum of rating when grouped by industry but sum greater than 5 sort by sum count
 
 
 # NOTES: 
 # WHERE statements cannot refer to aggregations specified in the SELECT clause..
 # A HAVING clause in SQL specifies that an SQL SELECT statement must only return rows where aggregate values meet the specified conditions.
 # HAVING is usually used in a GROUP BY clause, but even if you are not using GROUP BY clause, you can use HAVING to function like a WHERE clause. You must use HAVING with SQL SELECT.
 
 16. display sum of rating when grouped by industry but sum greater than 5 where ratings only greater than 8 also sort by sum count
 
 # NOTES :here the where clause is executed first so the values in 15, 16 queries will differ
